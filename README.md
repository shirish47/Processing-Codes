# Processing-Codes
Currently this are the files for my work which similar to that of robert hodgin's addition subtraction. Lots of things you can change. 
keyboard controls:
1) space bar ' ': stop and starts the simulation, but will refresh the screen view(you can change this by removing background(0) from keyPressed() func).
2) 'R' or 'r': starts recording screenshots to output folder in sketch folder. You can later make moives.

You can add attractors with mouse clicks. Also you can make text as attractors(will Required you to have font files as ttf). 
IF you dont want to draw text as attractors comment if(points!=null) block and be sure to Add some attractors by mouse.
only geomerative library is required to install.

Any one can use this code if you need help let me know .
